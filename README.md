Howler is a project designed for open learning of the architecture and components of a chat service like Discord. See the latest tickets on our public JIRA tracker: https://howler.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/HOWL/issues/?filter=allissues

Live stream development and learning sessions are hosted every Saturday at 6pm Pacific Time (unless otherwise announced) at https://twitch.tv/Swearw0lves
